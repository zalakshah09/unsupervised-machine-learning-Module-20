# Myopia Patient Clustering
This project aims to cluster patients based on their features in a myopia dataset.

# Data
The dataset used in this project is "myopia.csv" file that includes various features of patients such as age, axial length of the eye, and visual acuity.

Methods
The dataset was preprocessed by removing the 'MYOPIC' column and standardizing the remaining columns. Then, PCA and t-SNE dimensionality reduction techniques were applied to the data to visualize clusters of patients. K-Means clustering was used to cluster the patients into distinct groups, and the optimal number of clusters was determined through an elbow plot.

# Results
The analysis showed that there are distinct groups of patients within the myopia dataset that may be better analysed separately. The visualisation suggested that there are 5 such groups.

# Conclusion
Based on the analysis, the patients in the myopia dataset can be clustered into 5 distinct groups.#
